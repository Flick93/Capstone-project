    <h1>The Why</h1>    
    <p>My journey as a global nomad began long before I could choose my own path. As a military kid, I watched the sunset from bases across three continents, learning early on that 'home' is more about people than places. Those childhood experiences of constant movement and adaptation laid the foundation for my later years in the Navy, where I sailed to ports across the globe, each one teaching me something new about human connection and cultural understanding. Now, I'm passionate about helping others navigate their own international adventures, turning what might seem like overwhelming challenges into exciting opportunities for growth and discovery.</p>
